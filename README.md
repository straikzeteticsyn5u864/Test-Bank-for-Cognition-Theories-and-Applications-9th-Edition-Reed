  * Dr. Stephen Reed's Ninth Edition of COGNITION: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS focuses on the theories that underlie cognitive phenomena as well as empirical data that establishes a traditional, information processing approach to cognitive psychology. This structure allows readers to discover the direct relevance of cognitive psychology to many of their daily activities. The text incorporates unparalleled scholarship in a distinctive clear voice that allows for the emphasis of both contemporary and classical research through real-life examples and experiments. Revised and updated throughout to maintain a high degree of currency and accuracy, content reflects the ever-evolving field and is made relevant to students' lives through the inclusion of popular articles from well-known magazines and newspapers. As a result of its adherence to three criteria--the material must make an important contribution to cognitive psychology, be accessible, and be both understandable and interesting--the text is an invaluable tool in learning cognitive psychology.
